# roomba-robot

What is the name of your project. Who are your teammates (plus emails)
What is your final project, what do you want to demo on showcase day?
What do you hope / expect to learn in doing this?
How would you like it to be evaluated?

I'm calling this the roomba robot for now. As of right now I'm working alone and my email is vibhusingh@brandeis.edu

The final project will be a robot that can drive around every tile of a room. Best way to describe it is if the robot were to paint he ground of the room,
the whole floor would be covered in paint, or as much as could possibly be done without colliding with the wall or other obstacles.

I want to learn about mapping and finding ways to improve efficience and performance of a practical problem.

I think the best way to evaluate this would be to see the difference between the first and final iteration of this project, in both the complexity of the room that the robot can handle and how efficiently it can traverse the entire room.
